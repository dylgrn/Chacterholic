Characterholic is an application that allows you to create your own Dungeons and Dragons character without the hassle of a physical sheet of paper!
Having to update and keep track of a character sheet can be a real pain especially when traveling between playing locations. Characterholic consolidates all your characters in one place.
Characterholic also has a built in D20 role function so no more worrying about who’s bringing the dice!
